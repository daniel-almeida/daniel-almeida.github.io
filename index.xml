      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced Software Engineer particularly interested in software design and distributed systems. I find joy in building great software with other humans.

I&amp;rsquo;m a member of the Software Practices Lab working with Gail Murphy. My research interests include software comprehension/evolution and empirical software engineering.
The best way to reach me is by e-mail.</description>
